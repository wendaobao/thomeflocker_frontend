<p>The main purpose of our Zoom-In Guess room is to have people think critically and collaborate with other members of the channel to identify the image as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Room will consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>**Daily zoomed-in image** that can be optionally pinned to the top of the channel</li>
  <li>**Guessing opportunity throughout the day** with the image slowly zooming out if too hard</li>
  <li>**Chat box** where channel members can discuss and collaborate on their guesses</li>
  <li>**AI assistance** that posts hints if needed and reveals the answer at the end of the day</li>
  <li>**Profanity filter** to keep the conversation friendly and inclusive</li>
</ul>

  <summary>Additional Interactive Features</summary>
  
  <ul>
    <li>**Mini Game - "Guess the Zoom":** Players try to guess the object or person from a zoomed-in image, with clues if needed.</li>
    <li>**Posts and Comments:** Members can post their own zoomed-in pictures for others to guess and discuss in the comments.</li>
    <li>**Rate and Relate Theme:** After guessing, players rate the difficulty of the image, and connect with others on their similar or differing guesses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This interactive setup makes the game fun, challenging, and a great way to start conversations about perception and recognition!</p>
